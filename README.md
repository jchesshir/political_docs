## Welcome to John Phillip Chesshir's Political pages

By trade, I am a Software Engineer with a passion for Test Automation.  But I am also a disciple of Jesus Christ, a husband and father of 5 children, and an American who tends to be on the conservative side of the political spectrum.

I am just getting into the practice of writing, though, and as I want to make sure I make full use of GitHub's and Jekyll's abilities, I'm going to leave this README.md file mostly the way it was by default for now.  Check back to see any additions I've made.  Hopefully, it will keep looking better as time goes by.


###Opening article
Let's get started with a fairly lighthearted article on [Traffic Lights and Good Sense](https://github.com/jchesshir/political_docs/blob/master/traffic_lights.md).

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
