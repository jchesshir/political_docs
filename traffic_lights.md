## Traffic Lights and Good Sense

Why don't we treat red lights like two way stop signs?

Think I'm joking?  Actually, I'm serious.  Deadly serious.  You'll see just how deadly later on.

### Some merely annoying experiences
Of course, I'm sure most (if not all) of us have sat for what seems like 2 minutes waiting for a red light to change with no cars coming on the opposing green light.  But the other street is more commonly used, so of course, its light is going to stay green longer on average than yours.

And even more frustrating is when there is traffic sitting from three directions, but the green light AND left turn signal are stuck for 30 seconds for the one direction that has NO cars.

But we are programmed.  Programmed to believe that when our light is red, other cars are coming, and they should have the right of way.  What ever happened to the old practice we learned as children when crossing a road?  "Look both ways."  But what good would it do?  The light says cars are coming.

I'm a wierdo.  I drive my family nuts by going down the back roads where there are more two way stop signs than traffic lights.  I don't care if there is so much opposing traffic that I have to wait for a full minute before I can go.  More often than not, if there are cars coming, they are far enough away that I can beat them, and as long as I've come to a stop and roughly guaged their distance and speed, I have the legal right to do so.

Not so at a red light.  The only common sense move legally permitted there is a right turn, and I'm want to take it if there's nobody coming.

But if that was my only reason for writing this article, I'd keep quiet.  I've got to admit, my wife's admonitions to learn more patience has its merits.  But there's something more serious about my desire for us all to start treating red lights like two way stop signs...much more serious.

### Isn't this risky?
Yes and no.  There's a cost/benefit analysis that has to be done if you're going to change a law that the entire nation has come to accept as taboo.  Aren't you going to have more wrecks if people are allowed to start running red lights?  Perhaps.  But not necessarily.

You see, we're not talking about letting people just run red lights.  We're talking about letting them temper the absolute authority of the red light with a little good sense.  If the light is red AND someone is coming, then that other car has the right of way, just the same as if it were a 2 way stop sign.  (The nice thing about a red light is that, if the opposing traffic DOESN'T stop comming, they'll eventually get the two way stop sign turned on them.)  But if the light is red and NOBODY is coming from either direction, or even if it is going to be 10+ seconds before the opposing traffic reaches the intersection, there is not that much more risk of a traffic accident happening if we are allowed to use our good sense to go ahead and go.

### Where the risks will drop
But let's conceed that there might be at least a temporary, or possibly long term increase in the risk of traffic light related accidents when we allow people to start running red lights legally.  I still contend that there is another statistic that will drop significantly: Traffic related deaths.  This will happen at a minimum of 3 place/time points at which cars reach traffic intersections:

#### After long green lights
The scariest part about changing this traffic law is the question of how slowly the word is going to be spread.  There could be a lot of advertisement and debate about it, but invariably, word will not reach everyone before it changes.  Nevertheless, even if people don't hear about the change, they are eventually going to start noticing opposing traffic cross their lane while their light is still green.  After a little more time, they'll notice that there are actually cops sitting at those lights, but they aren't pulling them over for it.  "What is going on?"  Then they'll hear in the news that, because the cops are letting people run red lights, traffic accidents are going up.  And then, little by little...

They'll actually start watching out for crossing traffic, even when their light has been green for a long time.  And when they're watching out for that crossing traffic, they'll be more ready to hit their brakes when somebody pulls out in front of them a little too late to get out of their way before they get to the intersection where they legally have the right of way.  And even if they can't hit the brake in time to avoid a crash, they will at least be hitting the brake (as opposed to the gas pedal) when it happens.  Statistically, that can only turn out for a less deadly accidents.

Now that in and of itself will probably not cut down on traffic light related deaths by much.  But this second statistic will be dramatically affected.

#### Two way stop signs
I recently looked at research on what type of intersections tended to have the most traffic related deaths, and the answer surprised me.  By far, the most deadly traffic accidents are not at stop lights, but at two way stop signs.  This is really personal for me.  I had a nephew who is actually part of that statistic.

"Woah!" you say.  "Two way stop signs are the most deadly, and you want to start letting people treat red lights the same as two way stop signs?"  Absolutely!

I contend that the reason two way stop signs have become so deadly is because we have become conditioned to ignore them; Conditioned by traffic lights.  You see, traffic lights are put at intersections where it is well known that two way stop signs are getting a lot of traffic.  So even when we see a green light, we're conditioned to be on hightened alert, because it could turn yellow, and we'll have to make a decision whether we can get to and past the intersection before opposing traffic starts jumping out in front of us.

But as long as the light is green, we can feel safe, because we KNOW that when the light is green, no traffic is going to cross our path, especially if it has been green for a long time.  And because we've allowed ourselves to feel confident that traffic will never cross our path while the light is green, we've also convinced ourselves that traffic will never cross our path when the opposing traffic merely has stop signs.

But that is a completely false assumption, for two reasons: law and mistakes.

You see, the law currently says something different about two way stop signs than it does about red lights.  When someone is sitting at a red light, they are required by law to wait until the light turns green to go.  But when they are at a two way stop sign, they are legally allowed to cross your path if they've determined that they can be out of your way by the time you get to that intersection.  But they very well might misjudge how far away you are or how fast you are coming.  And if you're not aware that you're coming up upon an intersection with a two way stop sign, you are likely not to even see them before it is too late.

And that's assuming they actually follow the law.

But people are actually much more likely to accidentally run stop signs than they are stop lights.  Stop signs are rarely hung over top of the street like traffic lights are.  Furthermore, trees tend to grow and ever so slowly hide those stop signs, and if a tree is hiding a stop sign, it is likely hiding the other car as you come upon that intersection as well.

On the other hand, opposing traffic is much more likely to see and stop at a red light.  So we don't have to worry about that when we have had a long green light.  Just as long as the light doesn't turn yellow, we don't have to worry about opposing traffic popping out in front of us.

Well, maybe we should have to worry about it.  After all, the important thing is not that everyone is following the letter of the law, but that more people are driving safely.  Maybe if we have to be aware of the possiblity that someone might pull out in front of us before the light turns red (or even yellow) we'll also be more aware that someone might pull out in front of us elsewhere on the road as well!

Speaking of the light turning yellow, that brings me to the more deadly aspect of traffic lights...

#### Fresh green lights.
As I've stated before, the most annoying aspect of traffic lights is that we are trained to stop at a red light for opposing traffic, even when we can see that none is coming.  But the converse is the most deadly aspect.  We are also trained to go at a green light and ignore opposing traffic....even if we could see some coming if we looked!

But we're not looking.  Why should we?  If the light is red, even if no traffic is coming, we still aren't permitted to go until it turns green.  So we become laser focused on the red light.  We also might even check the opposing traffic's light, if we can see it, to see when it turns to yellow and then to red, so that we can be ready to go just as soon as our light turns green.

But lets face it.  There have always been, and always will be, the fools who assume that a yellow light means speed up!  And that is the point in time when traffic lights become the most deadly.  If we are only focused on going when the light turns green, we are very likely to pull out in front of oncoming traffic at the very point in time when they are going through that intersection faster than ever.  Had we pulled out in front of them while their light was green, we'd have probably gotten two things: a honk and, more importantly, A BRAKE!  But when their light has just turned red, they are much more likely to still have their foot on the gas pedal at the very moment that they plow into us.

Maybe if the law allows people to stop making the *ANNOYING* assumption that a __STALE RED__ light means __*SOMEBODY*__ is coming, people will be more likly to stop making the *DEADLY* assumption that a __FRESH GREEN__ light means that __*NOBODY*__ is coming.

I told you I was deadly serious!!!!

### A comical illustration
Now to _drive home_ my last point (pun intended), let's lighten things up by imagining a guy who is late getting to work.  Up ahead of him is a red light.  Under the current laws, this is likely what will be going through his mind.

> Oh man, I'm already 5 minutes late for my meeting.  HMM.  That light's been red for quite a while.  I'll bet if I time my arrival just right, it will turn green right as I get there.  Steady now.  Steadyyyyyyy...AHH!  GREEN ARROW!!!!
>
> Where am I?  What am I wearing?  Who is this guy in a hosptial gow.... "OOOOHHH!  I missed my meeting didn't I?"
>
> "Well, you've been in a coma for 5 weeks so, yeah, I'd say you missed your meeting!"

Now let's give this man the option of actually running that red light.

> Oh man, I'm already 5 minutes late for my meeting.  HMM.  That light's still red, but I haven't seen any cars pass the intersection in several seconds.  I wonder if I can go ahead.  Let's see, is anyone coming from the right?  No.  Anyone from the left? 
>
> <<<< SLOW MOTION >>>>>
>
> OOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH!  YYYYYYEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!  <brake> "RRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTT!"  WWWWWHHHHAAAAATTTT??????  GGGRRRREEEEENNNNN AAAARRRRRROOOOOWWWWW???!!!!
>
> <<<< REGULAR MOTION >>>>>>
>
> "BEEEEEEEEEEEP"  That jerk!  Now I'll be 10 seconds later to my meeting!

What this fool doesn't realize is that he just traded 10 seconds for 5 weeks of lost work, plus car damage and medical bills!

They say you can't fix stupid.  Well, perhaps not, but you can at least condition the laws to allow their stupidity to be more safe.
